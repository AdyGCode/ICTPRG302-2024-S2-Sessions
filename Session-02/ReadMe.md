# Session 02

This session contains examples and problems for
the practice on using the print and input
functions.

## Extra Resources

## Practice

All practice exercises are not assessed, but are 
there to enhance your learning.

Remember that it is better to try and work out the solution, 
and not succeed than it is to simply use Google, Bing, or AI to
find a solution and copy the code.

We have, for this session, provided you with the starter stub 
code, but you must complete the comments with the relevant 
details for each problem.

### Problem 1

Filename: `Session-02/totaliser.py`

Write a program that, asks the user for their name, and then 
asks the user for a number, plus asks the user for a second
number. 

The program is then to calculate the total of the two numbers,
before displaying the results in a form similar to:

```text
Jane, the total of 2 and 4 is 6
```

#### Hint:
Remember to convert the input from text (strings) to 
integers before using the values...

```python
number = input("Number 1: ")
number = int(number)
```


### Problem 2

Filename: `Session-02/multiplier.py`


Write a program to accept two numbers from the user. The program then will
calculate the result of multiplying the two numbers together. Finally,
the program will display the result in a manner similar to:

```text
7 times 8 equals 56
```

### Problem 3

Filename: `Session-02/constant-stars.py`


Write a program that uses the print() function to display three
words (store them in CONSTANTS) in the form:

```text
Python**is**Brilliant
```

### Problem 4

Filename: `Session-02/number-again.py`

Write a program that asks the user for a number. The program is 
then to calculate the total of the number entered and the number plus 1.

Finally, the result will be output in the form:

```text
10 + 11 = 21
```

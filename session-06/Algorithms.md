# Session 06 - Algorithms

An algorithm is procedure by which a problem (computational or otherwise) is solved following a certain set of rules.

You apply algorithms all the time in every-day life, often without realizing it. 

Here are some ideas:
- choosing the clothes to wear for college
- doing the laundry
- choosing a baby's name
- deciding what is for dinner

Every time you have a problem, you use an algorithm to solve it.

Algorithms tend to be "overviews" of problems and their solutions.

## Exercise:

- Write down FOUR algorithms you use in a week, excluding those above.

## Practice

All practice exercises are not assessed, but are 
there to enhance your learning.

Remember that it is better to try and work out the solution, 
and not succeed than it is to simply use Google, Bing, or AI to
find a solution and copy the code.

Refer to the following ScreenCraft HelpDesk article to learn how 
to enable PyCharm to add the standard header code automatically 
to each Python file it creates.
